عم # Commands to push to GitHub

# 1. Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# 2. Check branch name
git branch

# 3. Rename branch to main if needed
git branch -M main

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# OR if you already have a repository and want to force push (be careful!)
# git push -u origin main --force
